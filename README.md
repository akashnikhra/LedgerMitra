LedgerMitra is a greenfield desktop accounting application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript. It replaces legacy accounting software (Speed Plus) while providing a modern, intuitive interface for day-to-day bookkeeping — invoices, receipts, purchases, ledger management, and GST-ready reporting.

All data stays **offline on your machine** — no cloud, no subscriptions, no internet required.

---

## Why LedgerMitra?

- **Offline-first.** All data lives in a local SQLite database. No server, no cloud dependency, no monthly fees.
- **Privacy-focused.** Your financial data never leaves your machine. Backup is a file copy.
- **GST-ready.** Built-in CGST, SGST, IGST support with auto-calculation on invoices.
- **Legacy migration.** Full import pipeline from Speed Plus (`.mdb`/`.bmw`) — no manual data entry for existing users.
- **Lightweight.** Single Windows desktop app. No browser, no server process, no Docker.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — KPI cards, sales/purchase summaries, outstanding snapshots
- **Invoicing** — Create and manage sales invoices with line items, GST, and auto-numbering
- **Purchase Invoices** — Record purchases with stock updates, ledger integration, per-line discount %, and remarks. Full GST support.
- **Payment Receipts** — Receive payments with auto or manual invoice allocation, edit existing receipts with ledger reversal, view legacy imported payments
- **Ledger** — Customer-wise, year-wise, invoice-wise, and all-customers ledger with debit/credit summaries
- **Customers & Suppliers** — Party master management with opening balances
- **Products** — SKU-based product catalog with rates, GST, and stock tracking
- **Financial Years** — Multi-FY support with balance carry-forward across years
- **Print & PDF** — Invoice and receipt printing on A5 paper, ledger on A4, with save-to-PDF and WhatsApp sharing
- **WhatsApp Integration** — Send invoices and receipts directly via WhatsApp Web
- **Backup & Restore** — One-click database export and import
- **Legacy Import** — Full migration engine from Speed Plus MDB/BMW files
- **Multi-Company** — Support for multiple companies with separate books

## Key Accounting Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Double-entry ledger** | Every invoice, receipt, and payment creates debit/credit entries. Balances are always consistent. |
| **GST support** | CGST + SGST (intra-state) and IGST (inter-state) with configurable rates per product. Auto-calculated on invoices. |
| **Invoice aging** | Outstanding amounts tracked per invoice. Aging buckets for follow-up. |
| **Balance carry-forward** | Customer opening balances flow across financial years via `fy_carry_forwards` table with full audit trail. |
| **Auto-numbering** | Invoice and receipt numbers auto-generated per financial year. |
| **Stock tracking** | Product stock quantity updated on invoice/purchase creation. Reorder level alerts on dashboard. |
| **Payment allocation** | Receipts can be auto-allocated against oldest outstanding invoices or manually assigned. |
| **Line-item discount %** | Per-item discount percentage on purchase and sales invoices, applied before GST calculation. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v9 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> **New to development?** Run `setup.bat` — it checks for all dependencies and installs any that are missing.

### Installation

**Automatic (recommended for new users):**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/akashnikhra/LedgerMitra.git
cd LedgerMitra
setup.bat
```

`setup.bat` checks for Node.js, npm, and Git. If anything is missing, it downloads and installs it with your permission, then runs `install.bat` to install project dependencies.

**Manual:**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/akashnikhra/LedgerMitra.git
cd LedgerMitra
install.bat
```

### Development

```bat
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bat
npm run build
npm run package:win
```

The packaged installer will be in the `release/` directory.

> **Note:** On Windows, packaging requires either **Developer Mode** enabled (Settings > Update & Security > For developers) or running the terminal as Administrator. This is needed for electron-builder to extract code signing tools.

### Portable USB Build

Build a portable version that runs from a USB drive with zero traces on the host machine:

```bat
npm run build
npm run package:portable
```

The portable build produces a single `LedgerMitra Portable.exe` in the `release/` directory. Copy it to a USB drive and run directly — no installation needed.

**What happens in portable mode:**
- App auto-detects it's on a removable drive (PowerShell + wmic detection)
- All data stored on the USB: DB, WhatsApp session, merge output, temp files
- Temp files are cleaned up when the app exits
- No data is written to the host machine's `%APPDATA%` or `%TEMP%`

**Manual launcher** (for development/testing):
```bat
portable.bat    # sets LEDGERMITRA_PORTABLE=1 and runs the app
```

## Usage

### First Run

1. Launch the app (default login: `admin` / `admin123`)
2. Create a company profile
3. Set up a financial year (April–March by default)
4. Start creating customers, products, and invoices

> Your database is created at `data/ledgermitra.db` (or wherever `LEDGERMITRA_DATA_DIR` points). It's a single file — backup by copying it.

### Legacy Import

If you have existing data from Speed Plus accounting software:

1. Open **Legacy Import** from the sidebar
2. Enter the path to your `Upload\Data` folder in the "Data folder path" field and click **Set path**
3. Select the `spd.mdb` or `spd.bmw` file from the list
4. Analyze the file, choose company & financial year, then import

The path is saved and persists across sessions. You can also set it via environment variable:

```bat
set LEDGERMITRA_LEGACY_DATA=F:\path\to\Upload\Data
```

> See [docs/LEGACY_DATA_MAP.md](docs/LEGACY_DATA_MAP.md) for the field-level mapping reference.

## Migration

### Speed Plus → LedgerMitra

LedgerMitra provides a complete migration pipeline from Speed Plus (`.mdb` / `.bmw`) files:

| Legacy Table | New Table | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Items` | `products` | SKU, rates, GST, stock |
| `Account` | `customers` | Party ledgers, opening balance |
| `BillMaster` | `invoices` | Sales vouchers |
| `Ledger` | `ledger_entries` | Payments / receipts |
| `Company` | `company` | Company name during wizard |

The import engine handles:
- Multi-FY detection within a single MDB file
- Deduplication via file hash tracking
- Balance carry-forward across financial years
- Audit logging with skipped item details

Set the legacy data path via environment variable:

```bat
set LEDGERMITRA_LEGACY_DATA=F:\path\to\Upload\Data
```

## Developer Tools

### License Key Generator

Manage customer licenses from the command line:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/license-gen.ts                 # Generate new key
npx tsx scripts/license-gen.ts --regenerate    # Regenerate lost key
npx tsx scripts/license-gen.ts --verify <key>  # Verify a key
npx tsx scripts/license-gen.ts --list          # List all licenses
npx tsx scripts/license-gen.ts --search <q>    # Search by name or key
npx tsx scripts/license-gen.ts --export        # Export licenses to CSV
```

**Lost key recovery:**
- Customer has old key → `--regenerate` (paste old key, get same key back)
- Customer remembers name → `--search "name"` to find their key
- Customer remembers nothing → check your CSV export or generate a new key

**Best practice:** Run `--export` monthly. Keep the CSV as your sales record.

> See [scripts/keys/](scripts/keys/) for RSA key pair (private.pem is gitignored).
